## About the Book

__Django for Beginners__ is a comprehensive guide to building modern Python web applications with Django. The book proceeds step-by-step through six increasingly complex apps, covering Django fundamentals--models, views, URLs, templates--and more advanced topics such as APIs, user authentication, testing, deployment, forms, permissions, security, and performance. You'll learn how to solve common problems, implement best practices, and leverage Django's powerful third-party package ecosystem.

After reading this book, you will have a solid understanding of how Django works and the ability to build real-world, advanced web applications in a short amount of time.
